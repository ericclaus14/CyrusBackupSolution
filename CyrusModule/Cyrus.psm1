function Backup-VM {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Backs up a VM using Veeam.    

    .DESCRIPTION
        This function uses Veeam Backup & Replication to backup virtual machines.

        Requirements:
            * Veeam Backup & Replication must be installed (the free version is fine).
            * The hypervisors (Hyper-V or a paid version of VMWare) must be added to Veeam.
            * Must have access to (ie. on the same user account and computer as) the secure password file containing the backup encryption key.

    .EXAMPLE
        Backup-VM -vmName "Centurion1" -hypervisorName "Isaac" -backupDirectory "\\nas1\v$\VM Backups\Centurion1" -encryptionKeyFile "C:\keys\vmEncryption.txt"
        Backs up a VM named "Centurion1" on a hypervisor named "Isaac" and saves the backup file to "\\nas1\v$\VM Backups\Centurion1".

    .EXAMPLE
        Backup-VM -vmName "Dokuwiki1" -hypervisorName "172.17.0.96" -backupDirectory "E:\VM Backups\Dokuwiki1" -encryptionKeyFile "C:\Scripts\securePassFiles\vmEncryption.txt -disableQuiesce $true
        Backs up a VM named "Dokuwiki1" on a hypervisor named "172.17.0.96", disable quiesce (useful for Linux guests), and saves the backup 
        file to "E:\VM Backups\Dokuwiki1".

function Backup-Directory{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Performs Full or Incremental backups on the NAS.    

    .DESCRIPTION
        This function uses the 7Zip4PowerShell module to compress, encrypt, and backup the file shares on NAS1.
        All folders inside of the NASShare folder on NAS1 are backed up.

        When an incremental backup is performed, only files modifed since the last backup was completed will be backed up. If no 
        files have been modied since the last backup, an error will occur. The backup name (specified with the -Name parameter) 
        MUST be the same everytime you perform a backup in order for the previous backup to be found.
        
        Requirements:
            * Must have access to (ie. on the same user account and computer as) the secure password file containing the backup encryption key.

    .EXAMPLE
        Backup-Directory -BackupSource "C:\myfiles\dirToBeBackedUp" -BackupDestinationDir "C:\Backup\myfiles" -Name "My Files" -Type Full -EncryptionKey "C:\Repos\CyrusBackupSolution\Other\SecurePasswordFiles\dirEncryption"
        Perform a full backup of "C:\myfiles\dirToBeBackedUp"

    .EXAMPLE
        Backup-Directory -BackupSource "\\filesvr\NetworkShare" -BackupDestinationDir "C:\Backup" -Name "Network Share" -Type Incremental -EncryptionKey "C:\Repos\CyrusBackupSolution\Other\SecurePasswordFiles\dirEncryption" -Exclude "\\*.txt|\\git"
        Perform an incremental backup of "\\filesvr\NetworkShare" and exclude any files or folders with a .txt file type or with "git" in the path name.

function Backup-GroupPolicy{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        This is a Powershell script to automatically backup all GPOs.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This script can be used to automate the backup of all group policy objects.
        It performs an incremental backup and only backs up GPOs that have been
        modified since their last backup. 

        The Group Policy Management feature (or Remote Server Administration Tools, 
        RSAT, if on Windows 10 and not Server 2016) needs to be installed in order
        for the grouppolicy module, needed by this script, to import.

        Thanks to Matt Browne, MattB101, for his script named GPO_Backup.ps1. 
        The incremental backup part of this script is based upon his script.
        The link to his script is in the LINK section.

# Manage secure storage and retieval of passwords
function Get-SecurePass {
        <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Retrieves a password from a secure password file and creates a PSCredential object.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This is a Powershell function to retrieve a password from a secure password file and
    create a PSCredential object. It is used in conjunction with files created using 
    ConvertFrom-SecureString (I recommend using New-SecurePassFile).
    
    You can optionally supply a username to include in the PSCredential object.

    This function must be run on the same computer and by the same user account that were
    used to create the secure password file. 

    A plain text password can be gotten from a secure password file by running:
        (Get-SecurePassword $encryptionKeyFile).GetNetworkCredential().Password

    See New-SecurePassFile to create a new secure password file.

    .OUTPUTS
    [PSCredential] or [string]

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-SecurePassword "C:\Scripts\837839423"
    Returns a PSCredential object made from the password in "C:\Scripts\837839423".

    .EXAMPLE
    $creds = Get-SecurePassword -PwdFile "\\svr\pwds\password.txt" -userName "Eric Claus"
    Sets $creds to a PSCredential object made from the password in "\\svr\pwds\password.txt"
    and the username "Eric Claus".

    .EXAMPLE
    (Get-SecurePassword "C:\path\to\file").GetNetworkCredential().Password

function New-SecurePassFile {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Creates a secure password file which can be used to retrieve the password at a later time.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    This is a Powershell function to create a secure password file. It can be run one time to
    create a secure password that will be used in scripts that require automation.
    
    It prompts for the password to be entered and then converts it to a secure string and saves
    it to a file. It returns the path to the secure password file as a string. The file name is
    randomly generated and the directory it is located in can be either left to the default path
    defined in the script, or a directory specified with the -PwdFileDir parameter.
    
    This function must be run on the same computer and by the same user account that will run any 
    scripts that reference the secure password file.
    
    This function can be used in conjuction with Get-SecurePassword to store a secure password
    and then reference it as plain text in a script. It is useful for scripts that require both 
    automation and plain text passwords.  
    
    See Get-SecurePassword to convert the secure password file to a plain text password in scripts.
      
    .OUTPUTS
    [string] path to the secure password file.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    New-SecurePassFile.ps1
    Prompts for a password, then converts it to a secure string and saves the file to the default directory.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    New-SecurePassFile "C:\myPwds\"
    Prompts for a password, then converts it to a secure string and saves the file to the "C:\myPwds\" directory.

# Compare files for incremental backups
function Compare-Files{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Compare two files and return any changes.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
        Compare-Files uses Compare-Object to compare two files. It outputs
        the differences between the two files in a formatted table. By
        setting the -IncludeEqual flag, it can return all of the lines 
        that are unchanged, as well. 

        If differences between the two files are found, an array containing
        the differences is returned. The output has the format:

        Line Number    <name of older file>    <name of newer file>    Action
        -----------    --------------------    --------------------    ------
                  4    This is a line of text                          Removed
                 12                            A new line of text      Added    

    .INPUTS
        This script does not accept any piped inputs.
    
    .OUTPUTS
        None, or [System.Array]
