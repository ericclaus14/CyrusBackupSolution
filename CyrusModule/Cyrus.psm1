# Perform backups
function Backup-VM {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Backs up a VM using Veeam.    

    .DESCRIPTION
        This function uses Veeam Backup & Replication to backup virtual machines.

        Requirements:
            * Veeam Backup & Replication must be installed (the free version is fine).
            * The hypervisors (Hyper-V or a paid version of VMWare) must be added to Veeam.
            * Must have access to (ie. on the same user account and computer as) the secure password file containing the backup encryption key.

    .EXAMPLE
        Backup-VM -vmName "Centurion1" -hypervisorName "Isaac" -backupDirectory "\\nas1\v$\VM Backups\Centurion1" -encryptionKeyFile "C:\keys\vmEncryption.txt"
        Backs up a VM named "Centurion1" on a hypervisor named "Isaac" and saves the backup file to "\\nas1\v$\VM Backups\Centurion1".

    .EXAMPLE
        Backup-VM -vmName "Dokuwiki1" -hypervisorName "172.17.0.96" -backupDirectory "E:\VM Backups\Dokuwiki1" -encryptionKeyFile "C:\Scripts\securePassFiles\vmEncryption.txt -disableQuiesce $true
        Backs up a VM named "Dokuwiki1" on a hypervisor named "172.17.0.96", disable quiesce (useful for Linux guests), and saves the backup 
        file to "E:\VM Backups\Dokuwiki1".

function Backup-Directory{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Performs Full or Incremental backups on the NAS.    

    .DESCRIPTION
        This function uses the 7Zip4PowerShell module to compress, encrypt, and backup the file shares on NAS1.
        All folders inside of the NASShare folder on NAS1 are backed up.

        When an incremental backup is performed, only files modifed since the last backup was completed will be backed up. If no 
        files have been modied since the last backup, an error will occur. The backup name (specified with the -Name parameter) 
        MUST be the same everytime you perform a backup in order for the previous backup to be found.
        
        Requirements:
            * Must have access to (ie. on the same user account and computer as) the secure password file containing the backup encryption key.

    .EXAMPLE
        Backup-Directory -BackupSource "C:\myfiles\dirToBeBackedUp" -BackupDestinationDir "C:\Backup\myfiles" -Name "My Files" -Type Full -EncryptionKey "C:\Repos\CyrusBackupSolution\Other\SecurePasswordFiles\dirEncryption"
        Perform a full backup of "C:\myfiles\dirToBeBackedUp"

    .EXAMPLE
        Backup-Directory -BackupSource "\\filesvr\NetworkShare" -BackupDestinationDir "C:\Backup" -Name "Network Share" -Type Incremental -EncryptionKey "C:\Repos\CyrusBackupSolution\Other\SecurePasswordFiles\dirEncryption" -Exclude "\\*.txt|\\git"
        Perform an incremental backup of "\\filesvr\NetworkShare" and exclude any files or folders with a .txt file type or with "git" in the path name.

function Backup-SshAppliance{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Performs a full or incremental backup on an SSH appliance using TFTP.    

    .DESCRIPTION
        This function uses the Posh-SSH module to SSH into a target device and run a command, or list of commands, 
        specified when calling the function. It starts and stops an installed TFTP server and enables and disables
        an existing TFTP inbound firewall rule.

        When an incremental backup is performed, only files modifed since the last backup was completed will be backed up. If no 
        files have been modied since the last backup. The Compare-Files function is used to check for any differences between
        the new backup and the most recent backup to see if the device has been changed. 
        
        Requirements:
            * Must have access to (ie. on the same user account and computer as) the secure password file containing the password for the SSH user.
            * Solarwinds TFTP server must be installed.
            * An inbound firewall rule named "TFTP" allowing UDP port 69 must exist in the Windows Firewall.

    .EXAMPLE
        # Backups up device 10.7.2.3 by running the two commands specified in the array in the -CommandList parameter. Performs an incremental backup and uses an SSH Shell Stream.
        Backup-SshAppliance -DeviceIPs "10.7.2.3" -CommandList ("command one", "command two") -BackupDirectory C:\Backups -LogDirectory C:\BackupLogs -Username root -SecurePasswordFile C:\path\to\secure\pass\file -Incremental -SshShellStream -PrependDate
    
    .EXAMPLE
        # Backups up devices 10.7.2.3 and 10.7.2.4 by running command specified. Performs an full backup and doesn't use an SSH Shell Stream.
        Backup-SshAppliance -DeviceIPs "10.7.2.3" -CommandList "command two" -BackupDirectory C:\Backups -LogDirectory C:\BackupLogs -Username root -SecurePasswordFile C:\path\to\secure\pass\file -PrependDate -PrependIP

function Backup-GroupPolicy{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        This is a Powershell script to automatically backup all GPOs.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This script can be used to automate the backup of all group policy objects.
        It performs an incremental backup and only backs up GPOs that have been
        modified since their last backup. 

        The Group Policy Management feature (or Remote Server Administration Tools, 
        RSAT, if on Windows 10 and not Server 2016) needs to be installed in order
        for the grouppolicy module, needed by this script, to import.

        Thanks to Matt Browne, MattB101, for his script named GPO_Backup.ps1. 
        The incremental backup part of this script is based upon his script.
        The link to his script is in the LINK section.

# Automatically delete backups as per retention policies
function Remove-Backups {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        This is a Powershell script which cleans up old files.
        Used to comply with retention policies for various backups.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
        This script can be used in order to comply with the retention policy for backups stored on NAS1. The script      
        removes backups that are outside the time frame for the corresponding retention policy. For example, if a 
        retention policy states that a particular backup should be kept for 31 days, this script can delete any 
        backups that are more than 31 days old. It can be used in conjunction with Task Scheduler to automate the 
        process. Multiple backups can be configured in this script, each with their own retention policy settings.
    
        Each seperate item being backed up (eg. software, files, configurations, or other items) can be listed in the
        script, along with the directory its backups are located in, the time span (in days) of backups to keep, and
        optionally, a specific extension to delete and a custom log file location. 
    
        The function which performs the deletion, Cleanup-Backups (not to be confused with the name of the script...),
        is called seperately for each item who's backups are being cleaned up. See the script for examples.

# Manage secure storage and retieval of passwords
function Get-SecurePass {
        <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Retrieves a password from a secure password file and creates a PSCredential object.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This is a Powershell function to retrieve a password from a secure password file and
    create a PSCredential object. It is used in conjunction with files created using 
    ConvertFrom-SecureString (I recommend using New-SecurePassFile).
    
    You can optionally supply a username to include in the PSCredential object.

    This function must be run on the same computer and by the same user account that were
    used to create the secure password file. 

    A plain text password can be gotten from a secure password file by running:
        (Get-SecurePassword $encryptionKeyFile).GetNetworkCredential().Password

    See New-SecurePassFile to create a new secure password file.

    .OUTPUTS
    [PSCredential] or [string]

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-SecurePassword "C:\Scripts\837839423"
    Returns a PSCredential object made from the password in "C:\Scripts\837839423".

    .EXAMPLE
    $creds = Get-SecurePassword -PwdFile "\\svr\pwds\password.txt" -userName "Eric Claus"
    Sets $creds to a PSCredential object made from the password in "\\svr\pwds\password.txt"
    and the username "Eric Claus".

    .EXAMPLE
    (Get-SecurePassword "C:\path\to\file").GetNetworkCredential().Password
    Converts a secure password in "C:\path\to\file" to plain text.

    .SYNOPSIS
    Creates a secure password file which can be used to retrieve the password at a later time.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    This is a Powershell function to create a secure password file. It can be run one time to
    create a secure password that will be used in scripts that require automation.
    
    It prompts for the password to be entered and then converts it to a secure string and saves
    it to a file. It returns the path to the secure password file as a string. The file name is
    randomly generated and the directory it is located in can be either left to the default path
    defined in the script, or a directory specified with the -PwdFileDir parameter.
    
    This function must be run on the same computer and by the same user account that will run any 
    scripts that reference the secure password file.
    
    This function can be used in conjuction with Get-SecurePassword to store a secure password
    and then reference it as plain text in a script. It is useful for scripts that require both 
    automation and plain text passwords.  
    
    See Get-SecurePassword to convert the secure password file to a plain text password in scripts.
      
    .OUTPUTS
    [string] path to the secure password file.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    New-SecurePassFile.ps1
    Prompts for a password, then converts it to a secure string and saves the file to the default directory.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    New-SecurePassFile "C:\myPwds\"
    Prompts for a password, then converts it to a secure string and saves the file to the "C:\myPwds\" directory.

# Automatically assign drive letters for rotating external hard drives
function Set-DriveLetter{
        <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        This function changes the assigned drive letters of the NAS and VM backup partitions on the Backup External Hard Drives.
     
    .DESCRIPTION
        This function can be called from the Cyrus Backup Solution core script to make sure that all drives and partitions
        on any removable media (such as external hard drives) that are rotated out have the correct assigned drive letters.
        This eliminates the need to manually change the assigned drive letters. 

        Drives are selected via a wild card match of their name, with the percent (%) sign being a wild card character. 
        For example, if you wish to change the drive letter of a drive named "SSS_7829DH", pass the following into the 
        $DriveOrPartitionName parameter (without the quotes): "SSS%"".

    .EXAMPLE
        # Set the assigned drive letter of drive "VM Backup Partition [1|2|3]" to "V".
        Set-DriveLetter -DriveOrPartitionName "VM Backup %" -DriveLetter "v"
