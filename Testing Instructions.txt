=========================================== Introduction ===========================================
Thank you for testing Cyrus Backup Solution (Cyrus)!

Below you will find instructions for how to test Cyrus. The testing evaluation survey will be based off these instructions. 
Feel free to do more with Cyrus than is listed here, however. The more testing you do, and the more feedback you provide, the better Cyrus can become!

As you go through each of the tasks below, please let me know any qustions or concerns you have. 
Please let me know if anything is unclear or incorrect in Cyrus's documentation or in the instructions.

The goal of this testing is to find ways to improve Cyrus and it's documentation.

=========================================== Task One ===========================================
First things first, please start by installing Cyrus Backup Solution. The instructions for this are included in the README for the project.
Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you run into any questions or problems, or if the documentation is unclear.

=========================================== Task Two ===========================================
If you're starting on this task, I'm assuming that you have gotten Cyrus installed. Great!
Now that Cyrus is installed, your next mission is to configure Cyrus to back up a directory (any directory). This directory should be backed up in two ways.
Please create daily full backups and hourly incremental backups of the directory. To do this, define two new backup jobs in Cyrus's configuration file, Cyrus-Config.ini.
Create one backup job definition to back the directory up incrementally every hour, on the bottom of the hour, and one to back it up fully every day. 

See the "Defining a New Backup Job (backing up a new item)" section of the README file and the comments inside of Cyrus's configuration file, Cyrus-Config.ini for instructions.
For now, set the retention period for both backup jobs to 14 days.

Please check these backups regularly (at least daily) to see if they are working or not.

Again, let me know if you run into any questions or problems, or if the documentation could use improvement!

=========================================== Task Three ===========================================
Your next mission, should you choose to accept it, is to use Cyrus to back up an SSH-enabled network appliance (such as a switch or a firewall).
Define a new backup job in Cyrus-Config.ini that backs up your chosen SSH-enabled network appliance hourly on the bottom of the hour.

Again, see the "Defining a New Backup Job (backing up a new item)" section of the README file and the comments inside of Cyrus's configuration file, Cyrus-Config.ini for instructions.

One thing worth mentioning is that there are four different backup job types relating to SSH-enabled appliances you can select from in Cyrus-Config.ini.
Which one you choose will be defined by two things: 
-First, whether or not an SSH Shell Stream is needed (e.g. HP switches require this)
-And second, whether you want to do a full backup or an incremental backup. Note that incremental backups are not possible if the SSH-enabled appliance's config is encrypted when backed up!

For now, set the retention period for the backup job to 14 days.

Please check these backups regularly (at least daily) to see if they are working or not.

Again, let me know if you run into any questions or problems, or if the documentation could use improvement!

=========================================== Task Four ===========================================
You may be longing for an easier way to check the status of each backup job. If so, there is good news! 
There is a web dashboard that can be used to monitor the backup! 
Your next mission is to open the web dashboard at least daily and check to see if the backup jobs are working correctly. 
See the "Using the Web Dashboard" section of the README for some details about the dashboard.

Yet again, let me know if you run into any questions or problems, or if the documentation could use improvement!

Once you have completed these first four tasks, take a breather (but please continue to monitor the backups at least daily) and let the newly defined backups fun for a couple days. 
Your next task will begin on day number three of this testing period.

=========================================== Task Five ===========================================
Welcome to day number three of testing! 
Your next mission is to change the backup frequencies for the following backup jobs created in Tasks Two and Three: 
-The incremental directory backup job,
-The SSH-enabled network appliance backup.
Configure them both to run daily at 11:00 p.m. (the top of the hour). Note that Cyrus-Config.ini uses 24 hour time so 11:00 p.m. would be defined as 23.
So, for this testing, you should now have three backup jobs defined in Cyrus-Config.ini:
-An incremental directory backup job running daily at 11:00 p.m.,
-An SSH backup job running daily at 11:00 p.m.,
-A full directory backup job running daily at whatever time you choose for it.

Please check these backups regularly (at least daily) to see if they are working or not.

I may be sounding like a broken record at this point, but again, let me know if you run into any questions or problems, or if the documentation could use improvement!

=========================================== Task Six ===========================================
Now, if Cyrus is working properly, you should have quite a few backups already stored for each backup job. Backups can consume a lot of storage space!
To help with this, your final mission is to configure the retention period of the SSH backup job. This is done in Cyrus-Config.ini.
Set this backup job's retention period to 2 days. Yes, this period is incredibly short, but this short of a time span will help make testing quicker!

Please check the backups regularly (at least daily) to see if all backups older than two days are being deleted.

And I'll say it one more time, let me know if you run into any questions or problems, or if the documentation could use improvement!

=========================================== Conclusion ===========================================
Thank you again for helping to make Cyrus Backup Solution better by performing this testing. Your feedback is extremely important!
At the end of the testing period I will be sending you a survey to help evaluate how well Cyrus performed for you.

Thank you!
